		    	    JavaServer Pages(TM) (JSP(TM) page) technology and servlets are the key web-tier technologies defined in the                    Java(TM) Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE platform). The Web Component Development With Servlet and                    JSP(TM) Technologies, Java EE6 course provides experienced developers of Java technology applications the                    knowledge and skills to quickly build web applications suited to any Java EE 6 application server using JSP and servlet                    technologies. Students are exposed to the current methods for analyzing, designing, developing, and deploying web                    applications with Java technologies. Lab exercises provide students with experience in constructing and deploying the                    small-to-medium scale web applications found in intranet and low-volume commercial sites. The course features the                    Java EE 6 technology, and uses the Java EE 6 SDK and the Glassfish Application Server. The students perform the lab                    exercises using the NetBeans (TM) Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This course is also an excellent                    method of preparing for the Oracle Certified Professional, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 6 JavaServer Pages and                    Servlet Developer certification examination.
