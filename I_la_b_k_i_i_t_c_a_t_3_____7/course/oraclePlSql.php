In this course participants learn the concepts of relational databases.                    Additionally the participants are provided with the essential SQL skills that allow them to write queries against single and                    multiple tables, manipulate data in tables, and create database objects. The usage of single row functions to customize                    output, how to invoke conversion functions and conditional expressions are covered. The use of group functions to                    report aggregated data is also included.                    <br /><br />Additionally students learn to create PL/SQL blocks of application code that can be shared by multiple forms, reports,                    and data management applications. Participants also learn to create anonymous PL/SQL blocks, stored procedures and                    functions. Participants get to learn about declaring identifiers and trapping exceptions. Demonstrations and hands-on                    practice reinforce the fundamental concepts.                    Participants use Oracle SQL Developer to develop these program units. SQL*Plus and JDeveloper are available as                    optional tools.                    <br /><br />This is appropriate for a 10g and 11g audience. There are minor changes between 10g and 11g features in SQL.                </p>             </div>        </div>    </div>    <div class = "panel panel-default">        <div class = "panel-heading">
