The course teaches the                    significance of object-oriented programming, the keywords and constructs of the Java programming language, and the                    steps required to create simple Java technology programs. Students taking this course can receive a solid basis in the                    Java programming language upon which to base continued work and training. The course features the Java Platform,                    Standard Edition 6 (Java SE 6) platform, and uses the Java SE Development Kit 6 (JDK 6) product.                    <br /><br />Students who can benefit from this course:                    <br />Beginners to programming who have basic mathematical, logical, and analytical problem-solving skills and who want to                    begin learning the Java programming language. This includes technical writers, web developers, technical managers,                    and individuals with a technical, non-programming background, such as system administrators                    Novice programmers and those programmers who prefer to start learning the Java programming language at an                    introductory level.                    <br /><br />Students who wish to
