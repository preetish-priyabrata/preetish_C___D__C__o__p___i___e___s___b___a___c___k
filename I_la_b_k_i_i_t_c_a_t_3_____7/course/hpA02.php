The HP Accredited Technical Associate                    (ATA) certification addresses those issues by providing the industry’s                    first architect-level, open-standards, cloud-focused curriculum                    and certification designed for the academic environment. A robust                    curriculum with practice exams and real-world HP lab experience                    infused with the relevant business context enables students to                    implement an IT solution from start to finish in small- and mediumsize                    environments.                    <br /><br />Through HP Institute, the HP ATA certification covers these essential                    IT areas:                    <br /> HP ATA – Connected Devices*                    <br /> HP ATA – Networks*                    <br /> HP ATA – Servers and Storage*                    <br /> HP ATA – Cloud                    <br /><br />*Prerequisite to attain HP ATA – Cloud certification                    <br /><br />HP ATA certification helps students gain higher job and earning                    potential through industry-recognized certification and high-quality                    education that provides practical experience with HP and industrystandard                    technologies. The HP ATA – Networks certification provides                    the knowledge and experience required to design a wired and wireless                    switched and routed solution that meets small and medium business                    customer requirements. Through this course and certification, you                    will learn how to explain and recognize networking technologies                    such as data link protocols, physical connections, layer 3 routing,                    upper layer protocols and applications, and multicast technology.                    You will also learn how to install, configure, initiate, and upgrade                    networks. In addition to troubleshooting those infrastructures, you                    will perform administrative, operational, and network management.                    Unlike other courses, you will also learn the implications of these                    technologies for customer needs.                </p>             </div>        </div>    </div>    <div class = "panel panel-default">        <div class = "panel-heading">            <h4 class = "panel-title">                <a href = "#collapseTwo" data-parent = "#accordion" data-toggle = "collapse" class = "accordion-toggle">                    Start your IT career                </a>            </h4>        </div>        <div class = "panel-collapse collapse" id = "collapseTwo">            <div class = "panel-body">                <p>                    Achieving an HP ATA – Networks certification signifies job-readiness                    in key IT roles:                    <br /><br /> Network architect                    <br /> Network engineer                    <br /> Network system administrator                    <br /> Technical support engineer                    <br /> Helpdesk support                    <br /><br />For HP ATA certification, training is delivered through Certiport                    authorized centers and approved learning institutions.
