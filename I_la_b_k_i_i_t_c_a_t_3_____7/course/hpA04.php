The HP Accredited Technical Associate                    (ATA) certification addresses those issues by providing the industry’s                    first architect-level, open-standards, cloud-focused curriculum                    and certification designed for the academic environment. A robust                    curriculum with practice exams and real-world HP lab experience,                    infused with the relevant business context, enables students to                    implement an IT solution from start to finish in small- and mediumsize                    environments.                    <br /><br />Through HP Institute, the HP ATA certification covers these essential                    IT areas:                    <br /> HP ATA – Connected Devices                    <br /> HP ATA – Networks*                    <br /> HP ATA – Servers and Storage                    <br /> HP ATA – Cloud                    <br /><br />HP ATA certification helps students gain higher job and earning                    potential through industry-recognized certification and high-quality                    education that provides practical experience with HP and industrystandard                    technologies. The HP ATA – Cloud certification provides the                    skills and knowledge required to understand a customer’s business                    objectives and to design, implement, and support end-to-end IT                    solutions in a small to medium business context. In the course, you                    will learn industry-standard virtualization technologies, including                    the planning and designing of common virtualized services and                    their implications for customer needs. You will install, configure,                    and upgrade servers, storage, data networks, applications, and                    management in small and medium business environments. In                    addition, you will learn about hosted, co-located, and cloud                    solutions and the differences in functionality and cost between                    those and a traditional on-premises solution. You will learn about                    the business implications of each option and the criteria for                    selecting the appropriate solution (or combination) for a given                    business scenario.                </p>             </div>        </div>    </div>    <div class = "panel panel-default">        <div class = "panel-heading">            <h4 class = "panel-title">                <a href = "#collapseTwo" data-parent = "#accordion" data-toggle = "collapse" class = "accordion-toggle">                    Exam and course details                </a>            </h4>        </div>        <div class = "panel-collapse collapse" id = "collapseTwo">            <div class = "panel-body">                <p>                    <br /><br /><b>Explain and recognize                        industry-standard                        cloud and virtualization                        technologies and their                        implications for                        customer needs</b>                    <br />Describe and recognize common virtualization technologies and products and their implications for customer needs                    <br />Describe the business benefits of Virtualization                    <br />Define cloud and identify and describe various types of cloud services and their implications for customer needs                    <br />Describe the business benefits and risks of using cloud services                                        <br /><br /><b>Plan and design end-toend                        IT solutions for                        SMB customers</b>                    <br />Consult with an SMB customer to translate their business objectives into an enabling technology strategy                    <br />Gather the customer’s technical requirements and assess existing infrastructure                    <br />Design an end-to-end technical solution for an SMB customer, including on-premises, hosted, and cloud solution components                    <br />Design online presence and hosted services solution elements (incorporating both onsite and cloud components as appropriate)                    <br />Design an end-to-end solution for support/disaster recovery for an SMB customer                    <br />Write and present a solution proposal to the customer decision-makers                    <br /><br /><b>Install, configure, and                        upgrade end-to-end                        IT solutions for                        SMB customers</b>                    <br />Implement changes to the existing infrastructure to support solution—including servers, storage, data, network, clients, applications,                    and users (scenarios in teaching and testing)                    <br /><br /><b>Optimize and                        troubleshoot endto-                        end IT solutions                        for SMB customers</b>                    <br />Apply the HP troubleshooting methodology in an end-to-end solution environment                    <br />Troubleshoot common issues in end-to-end solutions for SMB customers                    <br />Optimize common performance issues in end-to-end solutions for SMB customers                    <br /><br /><b>Administer and manage                        end-to-end IT solutions                        for SMB customers</b>                    <br />Add users, groups, and profiles on cloud services in addition to local infrastructure                </p>             </div>        </div>    </div>    <div class = "panel panel-default">        <div class = "panel-heading">            <h4 class = "panel-title">                <a href = "#collapseThree" data-parent = "#accordion" data-toggle = "collapse" class = "accordion-toggle">                    Start your IT career</a>                </a>            </h4>        </div>        <div class = "panel-collapse collapse" id = "collapseThree">            <div class = "panel-body">                <p>                    Achieving an HP ATA – Networks certification signifies job-readiness                    in key IT roles:                    <br /><br /> Network architect                    <br /> Network engineer                    <br /> Network system administrator                    <br /> Technical support engineer                    <br /> Helpdesk support                    <br /><br />For HP ATA certification, training is delivered through Certiport                    authorized centers and approved learning institutions.
