This course helps the                    participants to write subqueries, combine multiple queries into a single query using SET operators and report                    aggregated data using group functions. Controlling privileges at the object and system level are also dealt with in detail.                    This course covers creating indexes and constraints, and altering existing schema objects. Additionally, participants                    learn how to create and query external tables. In order to query and manipulate data within the database, to use the                    dictionary views to retrieve metadata and create reports about their schema objects, participants get to understand the                    advanced features of SQL. Some of the date-time functions available in the Oracle Database are also covered. This                    course also discusses how to use the regular expression support in SQL.                    <br /><br />This course is a combination of Oracle Database: SQL Fundamentals I and Oracle Database: SQL Fundamentals II                    courses.                    <br /><br />For this course, the main development tool used is Oracle SQL Developer. SQL*Plus is available as an optional                    development tool.                    <br /><br />This is appropriate for a 10g and 11g audience. There are minor changes between 10g and 11g features in SQL.                                        <br /><br />Learn to:                    <br />Create reports of sorted and restricted data.
