The HP Accredited Technical Associate                    (ATA) certification addresses those issues by providing the industry’s                    first architect-level, open-standards, cloud-focused curriculum                    and certification designed for the academic environment. A robust                    curriculum with practice exams and real-world HP lab experience,                    infused with the relevant business context, enables students to                    implement an IT solution from start to finish in small- and mediumsize                    environments.                    <br /><br />Through HP Institute, the HP ATA certification covers these essential                    IT areas:                    <br />• HP ATA – Connected Devices*                    <br />• HP ATA – Networks*                    <br />• HP ATA – Servers and Storage*                    <br />• HP ATA – Cloud                    <br /><br />*Prerequisite to attain HP ATA – Cloud certification                    <br /><br />HP ATA certification helps students gain higher job and earning                    potential through industry-recognized certification and highquality                    education that provides practical experience with HP and                    industry-standard technologies. The HP ATA – Servers and Storage                    certification provides the knowledge and experience required to                    design an application hosting and data storage solution that meets                    customer requirements. Through this course and certification,                    you will be able to explain and recognize industry-standard server                    technologies and their implications for customer needs. You will                    learn how to plan, design, install, configure, and upgrade modular                    and rack-mount servers. You will also learn how to manage, administer,                    and operate server and storage solutions for SMB customers.                </p>             </div>        </div>    </div>    <div class = "panel panel-default">        <div class = "panel-heading">            <h4 class = "panel-title">                <a href = "#collapseTwo" data-parent = "#accordion" data-toggle = "collapse" class = "accordion-toggle">                    Start your IT career                </a>            </h4>        </div>        <div class = "panel-collapse collapse" id = "collapseTwo">            <div class = "panel-body">                <p>                    Achieving an HP ATA – Networks certification signifies job-readiness                    in key IT roles:                    <br /><br />• Network architect                    <br />• Network engineer                    <br />• Network system administrator                    <br />• Technical support engineer                    <br />• Helpdesk support                    <br /><br />For HP ATA certification, training is delivered through Certiport                    authorized centers and approved learning institutions.
